## ðŸ”¬ Lab Overview

Below is the list of labs covered in this course:

| Lab    | Topic                                 | Short Description                                               |
|:-------|:--------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lab 1  | Web Scraping                          | Extract data from websites using requests and BeautifulSoup.    |
| Lab 2  | Exploring and Preprocessing Text Data | Clean and normalize text data for NLP tasks.                    |
| Lab 3  | Language Models                       | Understand and implement probabilistic language models.         |
| Lab 4  | Vector Semantics and Embeddings       | Represent words as vectors using co-occurrence-based methods.   |
| Lab 5  | Word Embeddings                       | Use dense word vectors like Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText.          |
| Lab 6  | Linear - Logistic Regression          | Apply linear and logistic regression for NLP classification.    |
| Lab 8  | Neural Networks                       | Build feedforward neural networks for text tasks.               |
| Lab 9  | Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)      | Model sequences and time-series using RNNs.                     |
| Lab 10 | Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq)        | Develop encoder-decoder architectures for NLP generation.       |
| Lab 11 | Transformer                           | Explore the Transformer architecture used in modern NLP models. |
